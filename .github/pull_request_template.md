## About this PR
<!-- 
  - What is the bug/feature you make ? (If describe in the issue, don't repeat yourself, tell us)
  - Any other changes not in the issue ? Why did you add them ?
  - Add some scope to the changes if relevant
  - Try to give as much context as possible without any technical stuff here.

  For example : 
  We need some CGU in our app that the user must accept before doing anythig. See issue #42 for more informations.

  In this PR I've created : 
  - The CGU structure/database with a version for each CGU
  - the API to get the current CGU version for the user. 
  - The business logic to validate the CGU
  What is Out of scope : 
  - The mix task to create a new CGU
  - The Admin API to manage the CGU

  This is only back-end related stuff. For the front-end part, see this issue : #1337

## Technical highlight/advice
<!-- 
    This part is for technical stuff.
    - Tell us what did you change to implement the feature or fix the bug.
    - Don't detail it too much if it's simple stuff.
    - Add more information if you made significant changes that can affect others.

    For example : 
    To create the new API, I've created a new `CGUController` and a `CGU` Context.
    2 new routes : 
     - GET /api/cgu
     - POST /api/cgu/accept
    I've created a new table in the database with a migration.
    The CGU is linked to the user (Many to Many).
    I've added the rule to deny anyone that did not accept the CGU.

  Try to be rather explicit but keep it as simple as possible.

  Example : 
  - On server :

    - `mix ecto.migrate`
    - `mix phx.server`
  Use the thunder client in vscode : 
  - Register/Login (get the token)
  - Try to access this api without validating CGU : GET /api/apps. It should fail.
  - Validate the CGU ising the API POST /api/cgu/accept
  - Access the API agail, now it should work.
